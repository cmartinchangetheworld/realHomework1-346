# How it all starts

During this project, I have learned how to use unit testing inside
the __NetBeans__ IDE. I used problem solving as well as active learning
to finish this assignment with _almost_ no errors.

## Some errors still here

I ran into an issue with two specific methods for our unit testing project.

1. Testing after
	* I was not able to determine how to complete this function, as my implementation
	  to determine where the expected output was inside the list.
2. Testing insert
	* Insert provided a problem for me in that I did not understand what to test with
	  this function and if this function needed to keep the original list intact. This
	  function did not make sense if you wanted to use any input besides the first
	  element in the list, as finding the previous element in the list is impossible
	  with the current implementation.

### Current Fun

I am currently writing this README file having fun describing the process of writing this
assignment and playing with git and github.
